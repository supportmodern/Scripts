# Win10 1903 RSAT source files size = 154MB

#Specify ISO Source location
#Sources files are in current folder by using ".\". Best approach for SCCM/MDT OSD. Create SCCM package and place this PowerShell script in the same folder as RSAT content.
# Reference this script name in the SCCM/MDT command line of the task sequence step.
